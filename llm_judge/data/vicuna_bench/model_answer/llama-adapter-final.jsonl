In this episode, we will be discussing the influence of streaming platforms on the music industry.\n\n[Intro Music]\n\n[Host] Welcome to the [Podcast Name] podcast. In this episode, we will be discussing the influence of streaming platforms on the music industry. Streaming platforms have revolutionized the way we listen to music, and have had a significant impact on the music industry. \n\n[Host] Let's start by looking at the history of streaming platforms. The first streaming platform was Napster, which was launched in 1999. It allowed users to share music files over the internet, and was a major disruptor in the music industry. \n\n[Host] Since then, streaming platforms have continued to evolve and grow. Today, there are a number of popular streaming platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal. These platforms have changed the way we listen to music, and have had a significant impact on the music industry. \n\n[Host] Let's take a look at some of the ways streaming platforms have changed the music industry. \n\n[Host] First, streaming platforms have made it easier for artists to reach a wider audience. Before streaming platforms, artists had to rely on physical copies of their music to be sold in stores. This meant that artists had to spend a lot of money on marketing and distribution. \n\n[Host] With streaming platforms, artists can reach a much larger audience, and can make their music available to anyone with an internet connection. This has made it easier for artists to connect with their fans and build a loyal following. \n\n[Host] Second, streaming platforms have made it easier for artists to make money from their music.
